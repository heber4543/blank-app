# END TO END PROYECT

This is a project for the Machine Learning course in the Master's program in Computer Engineering

### Acces
Click [here](https://endtoendproyect17.streamlit.app/) to access the app

### Dataset
The dataset is available as a CSV file in the `end_to_end/dataset` folder

### Data exploration and model training and test
The source code where the dataset was explored, the data was prepared, and the model was developed can be found in the `end_to_end/code` directory, in the file named `proyect.py`. In the `end_to_end/code directory`, there are also two other files: `full_pipeline.pkl` and `lin_reg_best.pkl`, which are the pipeline and the best model files to be used in the app.

### APP
You will find two files: `requirements.txt` and `streamlit_app.py`. The first contains the libraries required to run the app. The second is the app code (model implementation and interface).
